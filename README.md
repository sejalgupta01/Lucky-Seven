Lucky-Seven
===========
My first app
============

This is my first app in Android Studio using Kotlin.

It is based on the popular old-school game called "Lucky Seven" where the player guesses whether the sum of the numbers on two die
is below seven, equal to seven (referenced as "Lucky" seven) or more than seven.
